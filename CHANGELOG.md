#### üöÄEnhancement

![Example showing an Avatar stack now includes properties for "Stackable" and "Square"](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10384315/106191020-2f670480-615f-11eb-8085-193dcccdb36d.png)

- Simplified avatars and added the property of "Stackable" which allows for the 20px stackable avatar to be enabled from the base Avatar component. 

![Having "Stackable" toggled on will force the icon to be 20px in size](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10384315/106191153-58879500-615f-11eb-8ca5-b03a5d0bcee0.png)
- Replaced Stackable avatar with modified Avatar component in "Stacking combination"
- Avatars now follow the same properties as seen in code. We have removed the difference between User vs Entity and have simplified to state if the avatar visually appears as a circle or a square using the variant property booleans. 

<img width="535" alt="Buttons have new properties for variants including toggles for leading icon, counter, and dropdown" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10384315/105261711-b8b97e00-5b44-11eb-87ae-20d9356741e0.png">

- Button variants have been improved to include toggles for the leading icon, counter, and dropdown
_Note: Currently icons don't correctly change color. This can be remidied for now with by resetting the icon and the button's correct icon color will appear but the icon will need to be swapped again._

![Fix icon bug by resetting the override to the icon layer and reswapping the icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10384315/105269878-9ece6a00-5b49-11eb-8de8-cd462cefc326.gif)

_Note: Descriptions are still supplied to denote correct avatar usage between the circle and square shapes._

#### üöÄ Enhancement

Improvements to support new color modes in Primer. Read the [team post](https://github.com/orgs/github/teams/product-design/posts/52) for more detailed information on how we're handling color modes in Figma.

![example of color modes implementation in alert component showing all of the color values matching success alert variables](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10384315/101843649-88bb9b80-3aff-11eb-8ddc-72e19ac791eb.png)

Support for GitHub's new color modes has been implemented into the individual components to correspond to the functional color values supplied by [primer/primitives](https://github.com/primer/primitives).

To use be sure to turn on the [`Primer Primitives: light beta` library](https://www.figma.com/file/9vhDNyQpOono1vgi0qSViZ/Primer-Primitives-light-beta) as that is now the source of truth for all component color styling.
